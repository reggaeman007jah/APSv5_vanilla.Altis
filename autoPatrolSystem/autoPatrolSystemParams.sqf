/*
This file sets up some basic mission-flow params 
one/two/threePoint relates to states I use to determine how many directions the retalliation should psawn from 

April 2020
monitorDefence is a mission state - it needs to be declared at this early stage as it is used by an Insurance System, and needs to be declared (as false)
in order to work - but check this is actually the case! Maybe try deleting it and see if it throws an error

toDo / April 2020 / confirm why I now do not need the commented out RF trigger value below
